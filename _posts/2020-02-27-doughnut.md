Having discussed [Who Cooked Adam Smith's Dinner?](https://leftinwarwick.club/event/leamington/2020/01/26/who-cooked.html), we decided we wanted to know _what comes next_. Katrine Mar√ßal demonstrated that economics is broken, but how do we fix it?

Our next book is [Doughnut Economics](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19651110W/Doughnut_Economics_Seven_Ways_to_Think_Like_a_21st-Century_Economist_Jul_25_2017_Raworth_Kate), by Kate Raworth. We'll meet to discuss it [at noon on Sunday, 29th March, in Leamington Spa Library](/assets/cal/liw-3.ics). See you there!
